Markdown is a lightweight markup language based on the formatting conventions that people naturally use in email.  As [John Gruber] writes on the [Markdown site][df1]

> The overriding design goal for Markdown's
> formatting syntax is to make it as readable
> as possible. The idea is that a
> Markdown-formatted document should be
> publishable as-is, as plain text, without
> looking like it's been marked up with tags
> or formatting instructions.

This text you see here is *actually* written in Markdown! To get a feel for Markdown's syntax, type some text into the left window and watch the results in the right.

### Tech

AmericanFinancials  uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [Font Awesome] - awesome web-based text editor
* [Twitter Bootstrap] - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps
* [Javascripts].

And of course AmericanFinancials itself is open source with a [public repository]
 on GitHub.
